Democracy for America is a Burlington-based advocacy organization founded by Governor Howard Dean in 2004.  We work to push the country in a more progressive direction by providing web-based organizing tools for our members, assisting great candidates nationwide, offering training to aspiring activists and more.  Recent work has included campaigns in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement, marriage equality, voters' rights, opposing hydraulic "fracking", and protecting Social Security.  We're a staff of 23 bright, passionate folks working out of our South Burlington office.

The Technology Department at DFA is looking to add 1-2 web developers to our growing team.  We use Ruby on Rails as our core technology, and aspire to function as a best-in-class small web shop embedded within an organization that does great things.  We're launching into an exciting complete redevelopment of our web presence and tools in 2012, and need sharp folks to do the job right.  We're not a non-profit trying to cobble together a web presence with a shoestring budget, nor are we a stodgy government agency moving at a glacial pace.  We do good work using modern methodologies, and we take pride in the code we craft.

Already know Rails?  Awesome.  Got strong development skills in PHP, Python, or other languages but haven't tried Rails yet?  Join us and learn it on the job.
