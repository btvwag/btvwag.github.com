Many thanks to Nowell Strite for setting up the BTVWAG website domain and github account after the last meeting.

Please join us on December 1st, 2010 from 6pm - 8pm at [Office Squared](http://www.officesquaredvt.com/) for networking and a round table discussion on team workflow.  

To kick off the discussion, the Draker Labs team will share their story of moving from a SVN to GIT code repository, and how they use collaboration tools in github to assist in their web application workflow.  You may have used various methods to develop web applications in both a solo and team environment, and we look forward to learning and listening to your experiences.  The goal of the evening is to facilitate a fun, informal and active discussion of sharing from the group. 

As a practical guide for those interested in trying out, learning or improving your skills in team workflow with GIT... there will be a demonstration of how you can sign-up as a BTVWAG user on github and begin contributing to the BTVWAG website. 

Pizza will be provided.  Feel free to BYOB.

If you have any questions, please contact Adam ( adam [at] agillionapps.com ). Hope to see you there.
