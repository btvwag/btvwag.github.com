THIS EVENT HAS BEEN SOLD OUT! Contact adam @ agilionapps.com to go on a waiting list in the event a registered attendee cancels.

Please join us on October 26th, 2011 from 6:30 - 8:30 pm at
[Draker Laboratories](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=431+Pine+Street,+Suite+114&hl=en&hnear=431+Pine+St,+Burlington,+Vermont+05401&gl=us&t=h&z=16&vpsrc=0) for a presentation and discussion on Behavior Driven Development: An introduction to automated testing for web developers by Pete Brown, lead web developer for Draker Laboratories.

BDD is not about testing code. It is about changing the way you develop software, providing shorter feedback cycles, driving better design. This discussion will provide working examples using Ruby, Rails, Cucumber, and Rspec to answer questions like:

* What is automated testing? TDD? BDD?
* Why should I test?
* When and What should I test?
* What should I not be testing?
* Why is testing hard sometimes?
* What is the difference between acceptance and unit tests? Cucumber and Rspec?

Feel free to __BYOB__.

If you have any questions, please contact Adam ( adam at agilionapps.com ).
Hope to see you there.
