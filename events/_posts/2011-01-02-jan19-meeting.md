Please join us on Jan 19th, 2011 from 6 - 8 pm at [Office Squared](http://www.officesquaredvt.com/) for presentation and discussion on Getting started with CouchDB 

Many thanks to Bradley for preparing the next meeting. 

CouchDB is a document-oriented database that stores JSON documents, has a RESTful HTTP API, and is queried using MapReduce views. Each of these properties alone, especially MapReduce views, may seem foreign to developers more familiar with relational databases. This presentation will demystify the basic concepts behind CouchDB and give web developers a practical guide to getting started with CouchDB.

Bradley Holt is a web developer and entrepreneur. He has ten years of experience with PHP and MySQL and started using CouchDB soon before version 1.0 was released. He is the co-founder of Found Line, a creative services firm located in Burlington, Vermont. He organizes the Burlington, Vermont PHP Users Group. He is a Board Member at Vermont Community Access Media (VCAM), a non-profit community media and technology center. He blogs at http://bradley-holt.com/ and can be found on Twitter as @BradleyHolt.

Pizza will be provided. ($5 suggested donation)  Feel free to BYOB.
